# NodePractice
I have created this app while learning NodeJS and MongoDB.
One with basic knowledge of Javascript and prior experience of performing CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operation in any database with any programming language will understand this project at ease.

Aim of this app is to learn database insert, update, delete, select operations into MongoDB Atlas (which is a noSQL database) with NodeJs and ExpressJS.
